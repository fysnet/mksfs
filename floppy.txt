#  bootfile=filename  - This is the path/filename of the boot code

# You may use decimal or hexadecimal numbers
base_lba= 0         # LBA = 0

# The remaining list of files are the files that this app
#  should find and write to the "root directory" of the image.  
#  First parameter is the full path name of the file to copy, 
#  second parameter is the path and name of the file to use in the 
#  image's "root directory".
# The third parameter is a the DIR flag, indicating if it is
#  a directory or a file.
# You may have as many or as few as you wish.  Please note 
#  that this app does not check for out of bounds due to too 
#  many "root directory" entries specified below.
